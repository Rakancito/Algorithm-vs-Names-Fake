# Algorithm-vs-Names-Fake

Anti Cheat

Some programs with Fake names in their processes are m2bob and lalaker.

If for some reason they create a debugger against this, just change the name of the functions.

When the functions find a process that is suspicious, it will close the client and not let it open until the process that affects the client is stopped, this process can be observed in syserr.txt
